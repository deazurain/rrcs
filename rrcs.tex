\section{Introduction}

An introduction about what we are going to explain in the paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item RCSP
\item Precedence Constraint Scheduling
\item Continuplanning
\end{itemize}


\section{Problem theory}

Different aspects of the underlying theory leading to RRCS.  Per point explanation of the theory with references to relevant papers. This will be the main section of the paper.

\subsection{Research}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lombardi
\item Policella
\item Some other papers about continuplanning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

Short recap of previous section. Briefly goes through the steps listed above.

\section{Problem Practice}
This section will discuss how the practice problems can be dealt with using the theory described in the previous section. First, the problems that can be solved using this theory are discussed. After that, the problems which cannot be solved directly using the theory are explained. 

\subsection{Solvable problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the examples from the real world?
\item What are the underlying problems of these examples?
\item How can they be solved using the theory described above?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Not yet solvable problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the examples from the real world?
\item Trains, trucks, maintenance scheduling, etc.
\item Airport planning / different factors: maintenance / tanking / bagage / boarding
\item What are the underlying problems of these examples?
\item How does the above theory needs to be augmented in order to be able to solve the problems?
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The overall conclusion.
